Tutorial Exercise By cutting away identical squares from each corner of a rectangular piece of cardboard and folding up the resulting flaps, an open box may be made. If the cardboard is 13 in long and 12 in wide, find the dimensions of the box that will yield the maximum volume. (Round your answers to two decimal places.) Step 1: We want to do an optimization problem involving packaging. In particular, by cutting away identical squares from each corner of a rectangular piece of cardboard and folding up the resulting flaps, an open box may be made. If the cardboard is long and wide, our problem is to find the dimensions of the box that will yield the maximum volume. Step 2: Applying the example from the text, we see that the base of the box to be constructed and once the flaps are folded up (to give the height of the box), we see that the height of the box is . Recall that the volume of a rectangular box is "length times width times height," so our formula for volume here is in terms of the size of the corners cut away: 2x(12-2x)(13-2x)

Which of the following statements are correct? Select all that apply. Let the closed interval [a,b] be the domain of function f(x). The domain of f(x+4) is given by the closed interval [a-4,b-4]. If f(x) approaches g(x) as x approaches a, then the limit of [f(x) - g(x)] as x approaches a is 0. We can compute the limit of cos(x) by using the squeeze theorem. Let the function f(x) be the domain of g(x) and the domain of g(x) be the intersection of the domains of f(x) and g(x). If f(x) = g(x) = x, then we say that f(x) and g(x) are equal.

Daily production levels in a plant can be modeled by the function G(t) = 3t^2 + 18t, which gives the number of units produced in hours after the factory opened at 8am. The objective is to determine at what time during the day the factory productivity is at its maximum. Diagram: Not provided. Define variables: G(t) - the number of units produced at time t Define any constraints: No constraints mentioned. Objective function: G(t) = 3t^2 + 18t For the objective function - Domain: The domain of the function is all real numbers, as time can be any positive or negative value. Range: The range of the function depends on the time t. As t increases, the number of units produced also increases. Therefore, the range is all real numbers greater than or equal to 0. Work needed to solve the problem: To find the time during the day when factory productivity is at its maximum, we need to find the maximum value of the function G(t). This can be done by finding the vertex of the parabola represented by the function. Conclusion: By analyzing the function G(t) = 3t^2 + 18t, we can determine the time during the day when the factory productivity is at its maximum.

The Cobb-Douglas production function represents the relationship between two or more inputs and the outputs that can be produced. In its most standard form for the production of a single good with two factors, the function is q = FK^aL^b, where K is the quantity of capital used as an input variable, L is the quantity of labor used as an input variable, and a and b are positive constants called output elasticities of capital and labor, respectively. They describe the change in output resulting from a change in capital or labor. A is a constant that represents the total factor productivity, which accounts for the proportion of output not explained by either capital or labor. It is a measure of economic efficiency. a) In microeconomics, isoquants are curves that contain all combinations of labor and capital which generate the same level of output. Adding appropriate labels (remember, K and L should realistically be considered to be non-negative quantities and a and b are positive constants). b) The marginal productivity of labor (MPL) is defined as the rate of change of output with respect to the input of labor. Compute MPL and MPK for the function q. (These functions tell us about the additional output obtained by increasing one of the inputs.) c) The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) is defined to be the amount by which the quantity of one input has to be reduced when one extra unit of another input is used, so that the output remains constant. If we fix an isoquant g = c: i) What is the geometric interpretation of this derivative for the graph of the isoquant g = c? ii) It turns out that MRTS = yP/AL. Find the expression for MRTS in terms of K and L. d) We increase the scale of K and L by a factor r > 1, that is KLr = KrL. We say that there are increasing returns to scale if F(rKrL) > rFKL, constant returns to scale if F(rKrL) = rFKL, and decreasing returns to scale if F(rKrL) < rFKL. Find the relation between a and b so that F exhibits increasing, constant, and decreasing returns to scale.
