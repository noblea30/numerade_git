Computing the actual value of a convergent series can be a very complicated problem. The value of some series is so astounding that they have become famous in the history of mathematics, for instance: Euler's. Here we will prove another following famous equality using power series: (a) Compute the power series S(x) of arctan(x). (b) Find the radius of convergence R of its interval of convergence. Does the series S(x) converge? Hint: You may want to use two different tests for the convergence of series. Use a theorem to justify that S(4) converges. Does the same theorem allow you to say S(1) = ? Justify your answer. Let Pn(x) be the N-th Taylor polynomial of arctan(x). Show that for any natural number n and x âˆˆ (-1,1), we have: Pn+1(x) = arctan(x) + Kn(x). (e) Prove the famous equality using the Squeeze Theorem for sequences. Hint: Squeeze theorem for functions and sequences.

What should the ratios of bottom cost, side cost, end cost, and transportation cost be if the overall cost is at a minimum? Give the formula for the minimum cost and the corresponding optimal dimensions x, y, and z, in terms of a, b, c, d, and V. The general function is axyz + 2bxz + Zcxz + dVI(xyz). Now, to get the formula for the minimum cost, we need to take the gradient of this function, which is ay + 2bz + dVI(x^2 yz) + ax + Zcz + dVI(xy^2 2) = 0. If we add x times equation and -y times equation 2, we get: Zbz(x-y) = 0. So either Z = 0 or x = y. However, x cannot be 0 since it is not in the domain (makes the denominator 0), thus x must be equal to y to get the minimum cost. By putting x-y in the equations above, we have: ax + 2bz + dVI(x^3 2) = 0 (equation 4) and Zbx + Zcx + dV/(x^2 z^2) = 0 (equation 5). Adding x times equation 4 and -y times equation 5, we get: x(ax + 2cz). Since x cannot be equal to 0, x = -2cz/a. Now, if we place the found x equality into our equation as well, we get: z = [(a^3dV) / (16c^3b+c)]^(1/5) and x = y = -2cz/a. So the minimum cost is determined by the ratios of x, y, and z, which are all equal to -2cz/a.

One method of measuring the distance from Earth to a star is the parallax method. The idea behind computing this distance is to measure the angle formed between the Earth and the star at two different points in time. Typically, the measurements are taken so that the side opposite the angle is as large as possible. Therefore, the optimal approach is to measure the angle when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun, as shown in the figure. (a) Proxima Centauri is 4.22 light-years from Earth. If 1 light-year is about 5.9 trillion miles, how many miles is Proxima Centauri from Earth? (b) The mean distance from Earth to the Sun is 93,000,000 miles. What is the parallax of Proxima Centauri?

Consider the following maximization problem: max f(x, y) = xV(y) {x, y} subject to x + y = 2, x > 0, y > 0. Set up the Lagrangian function, L(x, y), then type out the seven conditions you must impose to solve the maximization question (Hint: you need six conditions like those from Question 1, plus the condition Lâ‰ 0). Using the seven conditions, solve for (x, y)*. Note you need to consider four cases (both positive, both negative, etc). Calculate U(x, y) to two decimal places (if necessary). Now consider a related maximization problem with no non-negativity constraints: max f(x, y) = xV(y) {x, y} subject to x + y = 2. Can you choose some (x, y) that gives the consumer more utility than they receive when x, y* > 0 (you pick one if you can)? Graph this maximization problem using Geogebra 3D. Include at least one figure (but you may include more if you wish). Why do you think the Lagrangian Method always gives us x â‰¥ 0 and never x < 0 (Hint: Look at the utility function and the budget constraint in 2D by rotating the 3D graph)?

The following two problems are from a separate situation, but still using the same notation for the decryption matrix. 6.) Let's suppose we are working on the assumption that thâ†’FB, and we get the possible relation f=âˆ’3âˆ’3e. The digrams following FB in the ciphertext are: QV, FI, WF, XY, KL, BW, QJ, TA. For each one, find what values of e (the entry in N) decrypts it to something of the form eâ‹†. (We are trying to find the value of e that gives a plaintext with lots of "the" strings.) 7.) For the previous question, you should have found that f=âˆ’3âˆ’3e did not lead to many "the" strings in the plaintext, even using the "best" value of e. For this problem, repeat what you did, but using f=10âˆ’3e. What do you think the correct top row of N is?
The occurrence of random events (such as phone calls or e-mail messages) is often idealized using an exponential distribution. If λ is the average rate of occurrence of such an event, assumed to be constant over time, then the average time between occurrences is λ−1 (for example, if phone calls arrive at a rate of λ=2/ min, then the mean time between phone calls is λ−1=12mn ). The exponential distribution is given by f(t)=λe−λt, for 0≤t<∞ a. Suppose you work at a customer service desk and phone calls arrive at an average rate of λ108/ min (meaning the average time between phone calls is 1/0.8=1.5min ). The probability that a phone call arrives during the interval [0,T] is p(T)=∫T0λ1e−λ1tdt. Find the probability that a phone call arrives during the first 45s(0.75min) that you work at the desk. b. Now suppose that walk-in customers also arrive at your desk at an average rate of λ2=01/ min. The probability that a phone call and a customer arrive during the interval [0,T] is p(T)=∫T0∫T0λ1e−λ1tλ2e−λ2sdtds. Find the probability that a phone call and a customer arrive during the first 45 s that you work at the desk. c. E-mail messages also arrive at your desk at an average rate of λ3=0.05/ min. The probability that a phone call and a customer and an e-mail message arrive during the interval [0,T] is p(T)=∫T0∫T0∫T0λ1e−λ1tλ2e−λ2sλ3e−λ3udtdsdu. Find the probability that a phone call and a customer and an e-mail message arrive during the first 45 s that you work at the desk.

Find the allocation of capital K and labor L that maximizes the following profit function of a representative firm: max(t * K * L) * A(K^0.33 * L^0.67 - W * X * L - r * X * K); where the wage rate is w = 1.84 and the cost of capital is r = 0.75 and the total factor productivity (TFP) is A = 4. In order to NOT have to maximize over two dimensions, I would like you to maximize this function with respect to capital K and various values for labor L. So within a loop, you need to maximize the function for L {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5}. The result should be nine optimal K values. Hint: I would define L as a global variable so you can change its value outside of the function.

Prove the following statement using mathematical induction. Do not derive it from Theorem 5.2.1 or Theorem 5.2.2. For every integer n â‰¥ 1, 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + ... + (5n âˆ’ 4) = n(5n âˆ’ 3) / 2. Proof (by mathematical induction): Let P(n) be the equation 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + ... + (5n âˆ’ 4) = n(5n âˆ’ 3) / 2. We will show that P(n) is true for every integer n â‰¥ 1. Show that P(1) is true: Select P(1) from the choices below. 1 + (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 4) = 1 Â· (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 3) P(1) = 5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 4 1 = 1 Â· (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 3) 2 P(1) = 1 Â· (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 3) 2 The selected statement is true because both sides of the equation equal 2. Show that for each integer k â‰¥ 1, if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is true: Let k be any integer with k â‰¥ 1, and suppose that P(k) is true. The left-hand side of P(k) is ---Select--- , and the right-hand side of P(k) is ---Select---. [The inductive hypothesis states that the two sides of P(k) are equal.] We must show that P(k + 1) is true. P(k + 1) is the equation 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + ... + (5(k + 1) âˆ’ 4) = ---Select---. After substitution from the inductive hypothesis, the left-hand side of P(k + 1) becomes ---Select--- + (5(k + 1) âˆ’ 4). When the left-hand and right-hand sides of P(k + 1) are simplified, they both can be shown to equal ---Select---. Hence P(k + 1) is true, which completes the inductive step. [Thus both the basis and the inductive steps have been proved, and so the proof by mathematical induction is complete.]

Find the maximum of the following function by symbolic computation f(y) = a + b*exp(-((x - mx)*(y - my))) Write a function which calculates the n-th derivative of an input function with respect to a certain argument of that function. Both the input function and the function argument should be passed as strings (instead of symbols or symbolic expressions). Note: You can use the findsym function to search for all symbols within the input strings. The MATLAB inline function allows you to create a function from a string. For example, >> fun = inline('exp(t)*sin(w*x)') Inline function: fun(t, w, x) = exp(t)*sin(w*x) creates the inline function fun(t, w, x) with three input arguments. Extend your symbolic derivative function such that it also returns the derivative as an inline function.

Lottery Winnings - Looks Can Be Deceptive State-sponsored lotteries are extremely popular and highly successful methods by which state governments in many countries raise much-needed funds for financing public expenses, especially education. In Michigan alone, during the year 2015, the Michigan Lottery reported annual sales of 52.7billion,generating795 million in net revenue for the state School Aid Fund, supporting public education (K-12) programs throughout the state. Retailers received annual commissions of 203.6million,whileMichiganLotteryplayerscollectedprizesworth1.69 billion. The table presents sales and funding figures accounted for by the Michigan Lottery since its inception in 1972 up until fiscal year 2015. The numbers are quite impressive. The Mega Millions multi-state draw, formerly known as The Big Game, joined with the 10 participating Mega Millions states, including California, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia, Washington, and Michigan. On December 12, 2010, the Megaplier, an add-on game for Mega Millions, began where players can increase their prize by two to five times. The Megaplier number is selected at random before each drawing. If a player wins a non-jackpot prize with their Mega Millions wager, their prize is increased by the Megaplier number drawn, and they can win up to 5million.BeginningOctober19,2013,theMegaMillionsgameintroducedanewfeaturecalled"JusttheJackpot."Thisfeatureallowsplayerstopurchaseaticketfor3, which gives them two plays for the jackpot prize only, excluding any lower-tier prizes. This option was introduced to attract more players and increase the size of the jackpot. Overall, state lotteries have proven to be a successful means of generating revenue for public expenses, but it is important to remember that the chances of winning the jackpot are extremely slim. Looks can be deceptive when it comes to lottery winnings.

Populations that can be modeled by the modified logistic equation dP = PbP-a dt can either trend toward extinction or exhibit unbounded growth in finite time, depending on the initial population size. If b = 0.0015 and a = 0.28, use phase portrait analysis to determine which of the two limiting behaviors will be exhibited by populations with the indicated initial sizes. Initial population is 59 individuals. Initial population is 510 individuals. a. Doomsday scenario: Population will exhibit unbounded growth in finite time. b. Population will trend towards extinction. There is also a constant equilibrium solution for the population. Find this solution (note that the solution often is not a whole number, and hence unrealistic for population modeling). P(t) Solve the modified logistic equation using the values of a and b given above, and an initial population of P0 = 510. P(t) Find the time T such that P(t) goes to zero as t approaches T.

Problem #5: Cooperative Games Suppose that there are 100 students individually trying to decide between taking Game Theory or Public Economics. As we all know, it is harder to get personalized help from the instructor in larger classes. Therefore, the more students in a class, the less useful it is to any one of them. Let the payoffs uc and up from taking Game Theory or Public Economics, respectively, be given by: u(n) = 500 - nc u(p) = 556 - 3np A) Find all of the equilibria in this game that involve whole numbers of students. It may help to restate the payoffs so that both are in terms of np or both in terms of nc. B) Of the equilibria you found, which are stable, and which are unstable? For full credit, your answer must be accompanied by a graph. C) What allocation of students would maximize social welfare? Remember that there are only 100 students.
The Stark effect concerns the physics of an atom in an electric field. Here, you will explore the possibility that when placed in an electric field, the electron in an atom can tunnel out, making the atomic bound states unstable. We consider this effect in a simpler one-dimensional analog: Consider an electron trapped in a one-dimensional square well of depth Vo and width d: V(z) ~ Vo; for |x| < d/2, V(z) = 0; for |x| > d/2 Suppose there is a weak constant electric field in the negative z-direction with magnitude E. With this field present, the potential experienced by the electron becomes Ve(z), given by: Ve(z) = V(z) + eEz (e > 0) Assume throughout this problem that the two following inequalities hold: Inequality A: 2md^2 < h^2 Inequality B: ce < d It is worth thinking about what these inequalities mean. a) Set e = 0 in this part of the problem. Estimate the ground state energy E1 by recalling that the well is very deep (Inequality A). Is the true ground state energy (still with e = 0) lower or higher than what you've estimated? Explain clearly. Sketch the potential Ve(z) with e â‰  0. Are there bound states in this potential? Use the semiclassical approximation to calculate the tunneling probability T for the ground state. [Use Inequalities A and B to simplify this part of the problem; and to conclude that the particle energy is approximately -Vo.] As usual, write the answer in the form T exp(...), where the dots indicate an expression that depends on h, m, Vo, e, and d. Use classical arguments to convert the tunneling probability T into an estimate of the lifetime of the bound state. The answer can be written in the form t = h/T. Determine t in terms of m, d, h, and numerical constants. (Ignore the effect of the perturbation for the purpose of this computation.) Now consider numbers that are characteristic of an atomic system. Calculate the lifetime for Vo = 20eV, d = 2 * 10^-10 cm, and electric field e = 10^7 V/cm. Write your answer in the form exp(8) sec. Write the age of the universe Tu in a similar fashion, exp(? SCC). Write exp(0)ru, and determine e. How does the decay rate w = 1/t depend on the perturbation e? How does it and its derivatives with respect to e behave as e approaches 0? Could it be calculated by treating e as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian?

The Student Council organized a potato catapult contest on the school field. Students used catapults to shoot the potatoes into the air and down the field. Some students launched the potatoes while other students were in charge of collecting data using motion detectors and timers. Students analyzed the data to describe the path that each potato followed. Each team launched their potato and the data collected was plotted on the following graph: The distance (in feet) from the goal line is plotted on the x-axis. The y-axis represents the height (in feet). Team A launched their potato. According to the data collected, they determined the function that modeled the potato path by the equation y = âˆš(x - 15)^2 + 81, where x is the distance from the goal line (in feet) and y is the height of the potato (in feet). Team B's potato flew through the air and landed down the field. Using the data they collected, Team B calculated that the equation of the path of the potato through the air was 0.75x^2 + 18x, where x is the distance from the goal line (in feet) and y is the height of the potato (in feet).

You are a staff scientist for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, reluctantly sent along with an expendable security team and Ellen Ripley to planetoid LV-426. Your mission is to catch one of the aliens on that planet and study its genetics. Other than a terrible disposition, acid for blood, and face-hugging juvenile forms that implant alien eggs in your gastrointestinal tract, which mature into a rather violent bipedal form called the xenomorph, you find the aliens very interesting. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation, at great expense, funded a research project where you could raise the juveniles in a common, controlled environment and breed them (don't ask where the hosts to incubate the juveniles are coming from). The juveniles you call the "facehugger" stage of the alien life cycle. They are flattened with eight legs and a long tail that they use to wrap around their host's neck. They hatch from leathery eggs with flaps that open at the top when they are ready to emerge.You measure two other traits in the "facehuggers" stage in your population of aliens, including tail length and incubation time (the time it takes from the day an egg is laid to the emergence of a mature "facehugger"). Below are your data graphed with the measure on the x-axis and the frequency of each measure on the y-axis. What kinds of traits are tail length and incubation time (Mendelian, continuous, categorical, or threshold)?Tail length (cm):mean = 76.5 cmstandard deviation = 10.17 cm1510557-63 cm64-70 cm70-76 cm77-83 cm84-90 cm91-97 cmIncubation time (days):mean = 7 daysstandard deviation = 1.59 days30 25 20 15 10 53-4 days5-6 days7-8 days9-10 days

Plot the least squares line (solid) and the data (markers) on the same axes.Just because a least squares solution is a "best fit" doesn't necessarily mean the fit is all that good. People measure the quality of least squares solutions in different ways. One very popular method is the R-squared value:R^2 = 1 - (Î£(yi - Å·)^2) / (Î£(yi - È³)^2)where Å· is the least squares solution at xi and È³ is the average of the yi data points. An R^2 value close to 1 is an indicator of a good fit.Compute the R^2 value for the least squares line.

Your manager has asked for an analysis that will help inform strategic decisions about where and how to produce a significant product in the company's portfolio. Historical data on the cost of production has been gathered and aggregated into blocks of 1 week. The aggregated data was analyzed by a rather sophisticated statistics software package and the "best fit" model for the data was: C(a,b) = 0.2a^2 + 1.1a + 12b - 2.5b.Where C is the cost of production for a week, a is the number of raw materials packages received, and b is the number of units produced in 1000's.The coefficients in front of each term (i.e., 0.2, 1.1, 12, and 2.5) convert the term into US dollars. For example, the units on 0.2 are $/package.Find the values of a and b that minimize C.Note: You might not have done this in calculus, but it is not hard because it just extends what you learned for one variation to two. Remember, to find the maximum or minimum of a function, you take the derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve for the independent variable. So if this problem only had C as a function of a (C(a)) not C(a,b), you would have taken the derivative of C with respect to a (dC/da), set this to zero, and solved for a. To extend this to two variables, here a and b, you first take the derivative of C with respect to a (dC/da), assuming b is constant, and set it equal to zero. Then, you take the derivative of C with respect to b (dC/db), assuming a is constant, and set it equal to zero. You literally do what you learned before but do it twice. Take dC/da assuming b is constant and then take dC/db assuming a is constant. Set both equations equal to zero; hence, you have two equations in two unknowns that you can solve using algebra.Recall that with one variable, you took the second derivative to see if the point you found was a maximum, minimum, or inflection point. This part of two variables is much more complicated, so you'll just need to believe me that the point you find is a minimum.

Researchers have observed that rainforest areas next to clear-cuts (less than 100 meters away) have a reduced tree biomass compared to rainforest areas far from clear-cuts. To go further, Laurance et al. (1997) tested whether rainforest areas more distant from the clear-cuts were also affected. They compiled data on the biomass change after clear-cutting (in tons/hectare/year) for 36 rainforest areas between 100 m and several km from clear-cuts. The data are as follows: -10.8, -4.9, -2.6, -1.6, -3, -6.2, -6.5, -9.2, -3.6, -1.8, -1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, -0.3, -1.4, -1.5, -0.8, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.2, 2.9, 3.5, 4.3, 4.7, 2.9, 2.8, 2.5, 1.7, 2.7, 1.2, 0.1, 1.3, 2.3, 0.5 Test whether there is a change in biomass of rainforest areas following clear-cutting.

The president of Solutions Plus, Charlie Weaver, contacted several trucking companies to negotiate shipping rates between the two production facilities (Cincinnati and Oakland) and the locations where the railroad locomotives are cleaned. Table 10.9 shows the quotes received in terms of dollars per gallon. The entries in Table 10.9 identify shipping routes that will not be considered because of the large distances involved. These quotes for shipping rates are guaranteed for one year. To submit a bid to the Railroad company, Solutions Plus must determine the price per gallon it will charge. Solutions Plus usually sells its cleaning fluids for 59% more than its cost to produce and deliver the product. For this big contract, however, Fred Rocdel, the director of marketing, suggested that maybe the company should consider a smaller profit margin. In addition, to ensure that if Solutions Plus wins the bid, it will have adequate capacity to satisfy existing orders as well as accept orders for other new business, the management team decided to limit the number of gallons of the locomotive cleaning fluid produced in the Cincinnati plant to 500,000 gallons at most.Managerial Report: You are asked to make recommendations that will help Solutions Plus prepare a bid. Your report should address, but not be limited to, the following issues: If Solutions Plus wins the bid, which production facility (Cincinnati or Oakland) should supply the cleaning fluid to the locations where the railroad locomotives are cleaned? How much should be shipped from each facility to each location? What is the breakeven point for Solutions Plus? That is, how low can the company go on its bid without losing money? If Solutions Plus wants to use its standard 159% markup, how much should it bid? Freight costs are significantly affected by the price of oil. The contract to which Solutions Plus is bidding is for two years. Discuss how fluctuations in freight costs might affect the bid Solutions Plus submits.

Motorola used the normal distribution to determine the probability of defects and the number of defects expected in a production process. Assume a production process produces items with a mean weight of 10 ounces. (a) The process standard deviation is 0.15, and the process control is set at plus or minus one standard deviation. Units with weights less than 9.85 or greater than 10.15 ounces will be classified as defects. (Round your answer to the nearest integer.) Calculate the probability of a defect. (Round your answer to four decimal places.) Calculate the expected number of defects for a 1,000-unit production run. (Round your answer to the nearest integer.) defects (b) Through process design improvements, the process standard deviation can be reduced to 0.05. Assume the process control remains the same, with weights less than 9.85 or greater than 10.15 ounces being classified as defects. Calculate the probability of a defect. (Round your answer to four decimal places.) Calculate the expected number of defects for a 1,000-unit production run. (Round your answer to the nearest integer.) defects (c) What is the advantage of reducing process variation, thereby causing process control limits to be at a greater number of standard deviations from the mean?
Let's take one more step in improving this population model. Assume that there is a maximum number M that a population can sustain in order to survive over many generations. After all, there are limited resources in our world. When the population size is much smaller than M, resources play a negligible role in determining the population growth rate. When the population size exceeds M, it experiences a negative growth rate. When the population size equals M, the population growth rate equals zero.Show using notation what the paragraph above explains in three separate cases (when P < M, when P > M, and when P = M).Design a factor that will achieve this effect and write out the improved differential equation.Draw the family of curves that represent P in relation to t.

Capt'n Eli's Soda Company is considering developing a new carbonated drink to add to its standard product line of drinks for a couple of years or so (after which it probably would be replaced by another special drink). However, it is unclear whether the new drink would be profitable, so analysis is needed to determine whether to go ahead with the development of the drink. If the drink is developed, it would be first sold in a small regional test market to assess how popular the drink would become nationally. If the test market suggests that the drink should be profitable, it would then be marketed nationally.Here are the relevant data. The cost of developing the drink and then arranging to test it in the test market is estimated to be 40million.Atotalbudgetof100 million has been allocated to advertising the drink in both the test market and (if appropriate) nationally. A minimum of 5millionisneededforadvertisinginthetestmarketandthemaximumallowedforthispurposeis10 million, which would leave between 90millionand95 million for national advertising. Sales in either the test market or nationally is assumed to be proportional to the level of advertising, recognizing that the rate of additional sales would fall off after the amount of advertising reaches a saturation point. Excluding the fixed cost of 40million,theprofitinthetestmarketisexpectedtobehalfthelevelofadvertising.Theoutcomeoftestingthedrinkinthetestmarketwouldfallintooneofjustthreecategories:(1)veryfavorable,(2)barelyfavorable,and(3)unfavorable.Theprobabilitiesoftheseoutcomesareestimatedtobe0.25,0.25,and0.5,respectively.Iftheoutcomeisveryfavorable,theprofit(excludingthefixedcostof40 million for test marketing) after going national would be about twice the level of national advertising. The corresponding profit if the outcome is barely favorable would be about 0.2 times the national advertising level. If the outcome is unfavorable, then the drink would be discontinued and not marketed nationally.Use a two-stage stochastic program with recourse to determine the expected net profit (including the cost of test marketing) of developing the proposed new drink. Be sure to explain your decision variables and constraints and/or give them meaningful names that make it clear what they represent.Explain the solution to your model from part (a) in English.What is the expected value of perfect information in the situation?
