Computing the actual value of a convergent series can be a very complicated problem. The value of some series is so astounding that they have become famous in the history of mathematics, for instance: Euler's. Here we will prove another following famous equality using power series: (a) Compute the power series S(x) of arctan(x). (b) Find the radius of convergence R of its interval of convergence. Does the series S(x) converge? Hint: You may want to use two different tests for the convergence of series. Use a theorem to justify that S(4) converges. Does the same theorem allow you to say S(1) = ? Justify your answer. Let Pn(x) be the N-th Taylor polynomial of arctan(x). Show that for any natural number n and x âˆˆ (-1,1), we have: Pn+1(x) = arctan(x) + Kn(x). (e) Prove the famous equality using the Squeeze Theorem for sequences. Hint: Squeeze theorem for functions and sequences.

What should the ratios of bottom cost, side cost, end cost, and transportation cost be if the overall cost is at a minimum? Give the formula for the minimum cost and the corresponding optimal dimensions x, y, and z, in terms of a, b, c, d, and V. The general function is axyz + 2bxz + Zcxz + dVI(xyz). Now, to get the formula for the minimum cost, we need to take the gradient of this function, which is ay + 2bz + dVI(x^2 yz) + ax + Zcz + dVI(xy^2 2) = 0. If we add x times equation and -y times equation 2, we get: Zbz(x-y) = 0. So either Z = 0 or x = y. However, x cannot be 0 since it is not in the domain (makes the denominator 0), thus x must be equal to y to get the minimum cost. By putting x-y in the equations above, we have: ax + 2bz + dVI(x^3 2) = 0 (equation 4) and Zbx + Zcx + dV/(x^2 z^2) = 0 (equation 5). Adding x times equation 4 and -y times equation 5, we get: x(ax + 2cz). Since x cannot be equal to 0, x = -2cz/a. Now, if we place the found x equality into our equation as well, we get: z = [(a^3dV) / (16c^3b+c)]^(1/5) and x = y = -2cz/a. So the minimum cost is determined by the ratios of x, y, and z, which are all equal to -2cz/a.

One method of measuring the distance from Earth to a star is the parallax method. The idea behind computing this distance is to measure the angle formed between the Earth and the star at two different points in time. Typically, the measurements are taken so that the side opposite the angle is as large as possible. Therefore, the optimal approach is to measure the angle when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun, as shown in the figure. (a) Proxima Centauri is 4.22 light-years from Earth. If 1 light-year is about 5.9 trillion miles, how many miles is Proxima Centauri from Earth? (b) The mean distance from Earth to the Sun is 93,000,000 miles. What is the parallax of Proxima Centauri?

Consider the following maximization problem: max f(x, y) = xV(y) {x, y} subject to x + y = 2, x > 0, y > 0. Set up the Lagrangian function, L(x, y), then type out the seven conditions you must impose to solve the maximization question (Hint: you need six conditions like those from Question 1, plus the condition Lâ‰ 0). Using the seven conditions, solve for (x, y)*. Note you need to consider four cases (both positive, both negative, etc). Calculate U(x, y) to two decimal places (if necessary). Now consider a related maximization problem with no non-negativity constraints: max f(x, y) = xV(y) {x, y} subject to x + y = 2. Can you choose some (x, y) that gives the consumer more utility than they receive when x, y* > 0 (you pick one if you can)? Graph this maximization problem using Geogebra 3D. Include at least one figure (but you may include more if you wish). Why do you think the Lagrangian Method always gives us x â‰¥ 0 and never x < 0 (Hint: Look at the utility function and the budget constraint in 2D by rotating the 3D graph)?

The following two problems are from a separate situation, but still using the same notation for the decryption matrix. 6.) Let's suppose we are working on the assumption that thâ†’FB, and we get the possible relation f=âˆ’3âˆ’3e. The digrams following FB in the ciphertext are: QV, FI, WF, XY, KL, BW, QJ, TA. For each one, find what values of e (the entry in N) decrypts it to something of the form eâ‹†. (We are trying to find the value of e that gives a plaintext with lots of "the" strings.) 7.) For the previous question, you should have found that f=âˆ’3âˆ’3e did not lead to many "the" strings in the plaintext, even using the "best" value of e. For this problem, repeat what you did, but using f=10âˆ’3e. What do you think the correct top row of N is?
The occurrence of random events (such as phone calls or e-mail messages) is often idealized using an exponential distribution. If λ is the average rate of occurrence of such an event, assumed to be constant over time, then the average time between occurrences is λ−1 (for example, if phone calls arrive at a rate of λ=2/ min, then the mean time between phone calls is λ−1=12mn ). The exponential distribution is given by f(t)=λe−λt, for 0≤t<∞ a. Suppose you work at a customer service desk and phone calls arrive at an average rate of λ108/ min (meaning the average time between phone calls is 1/0.8=1.5min ). The probability that a phone call arrives during the interval [0,T] is p(T)=∫T0λ1e−λ1tdt. Find the probability that a phone call arrives during the first 45s(0.75min) that you work at the desk. b. Now suppose that walk-in customers also arrive at your desk at an average rate of λ2=01/ min. The probability that a phone call and a customer arrive during the interval [0,T] is p(T)=∫T0∫T0λ1e−λ1tλ2e−λ2sdtds. Find the probability that a phone call and a customer arrive during the first 45 s that you work at the desk. c. E-mail messages also arrive at your desk at an average rate of λ3=0.05/ min. The probability that a phone call and a customer and an e-mail message arrive during the interval [0,T] is p(T)=∫T0∫T0∫T0λ1e−λ1tλ2e−λ2sλ3e−λ3udtdsdu. Find the probability that a phone call and a customer and an e-mail message arrive during the first 45 s that you work at the desk.

Find the allocation of capital K and labor L that maximizes the following profit function of a representative firm: max(t * K * L) * A(K^0.33 * L^0.67 - W * X * L - r * X * K); where the wage rate is w = 1.84 and the cost of capital is r = 0.75 and the total factor productivity (TFP) is A = 4. In order to NOT have to maximize over two dimensions, I would like you to maximize this function with respect to capital K and various values for labor L. So within a loop, you need to maximize the function for L {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5}. The result should be nine optimal K values. Hint: I would define L as a global variable so you can change its value outside of the function.

Prove the following statement using mathematical induction. Do not derive it from Theorem 5.2.1 or Theorem 5.2.2. For every integer n â‰¥ 1, 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + ... + (5n âˆ’ 4) = n(5n âˆ’ 3) / 2. Proof (by mathematical induction): Let P(n) be the equation 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + ... + (5n âˆ’ 4) = n(5n âˆ’ 3) / 2. We will show that P(n) is true for every integer n â‰¥ 1. Show that P(1) is true: Select P(1) from the choices below. 1 + (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 4) = 1 Â· (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 3) P(1) = 5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 4 1 = 1 Â· (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 3) 2 P(1) = 1 Â· (5 Â· 1 âˆ’ 3) 2 The selected statement is true because both sides of the equation equal 2. Show that for each integer k â‰¥ 1, if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is true: Let k be any integer with k â‰¥ 1, and suppose that P(k) is true. The left-hand side of P(k) is ---Select--- , and the right-hand side of P(k) is ---Select---. [The inductive hypothesis states that the two sides of P(k) are equal.] We must show that P(k + 1) is true. P(k + 1) is the equation 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + ... + (5(k + 1) âˆ’ 4) = ---Select---. After substitution from the inductive hypothesis, the left-hand side of P(k + 1) becomes ---Select--- + (5(k + 1) âˆ’ 4). When the left-hand and right-hand sides of P(k + 1) are simplified, they both can be shown to equal ---Select---. Hence P(k + 1) is true, which completes the inductive step. [Thus both the basis and the inductive steps have been proved, and so the proof by mathematical induction is complete.]

Find the maximum of the following function by symbolic computation f(y) = a + b*exp(-((x - mx)*(y - my))) Write a function which calculates the n-th derivative of an input function with respect to a certain argument of that function. Both the input function and the function argument should be passed as strings (instead of symbols or symbolic expressions). Note: You can use the findsym function to search for all symbols within the input strings. The MATLAB inline function allows you to create a function from a string. For example, >> fun = inline('exp(t)*sin(w*x)') Inline function: fun(t, w, x) = exp(t)*sin(w*x) creates the inline function fun(t, w, x) with three input arguments. Extend your symbolic derivative function such that it also returns the derivative as an inline function.

Lottery Winnings - Looks Can Be Deceptive State-sponsored lotteries are extremely popular and highly successful methods by which state governments in many countries raise much-needed funds for financing public expenses, especially education. In Michigan alone, during the year 2015, the Michigan Lottery reported annual sales of 52.7billion,generating795 million in net revenue for the state School Aid Fund, supporting public education (K-12) programs throughout the state. Retailers received annual commissions of 203.6million,whileMichiganLotteryplayerscollectedprizesworth1.69 billion. The table presents sales and funding figures accounted for by the Michigan Lottery since its inception in 1972 up until fiscal year 2015. The numbers are quite impressive. The Mega Millions multi-state draw, formerly known as The Big Game, joined with the 10 participating Mega Millions states, including California, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia, Washington, and Michigan. On December 12, 2010, the Megaplier, an add-on game for Mega Millions, began where players can increase their prize by two to five times. The Megaplier number is selected at random before each drawing. If a player wins a non-jackpot prize with their Mega Millions wager, their prize is increased by the Megaplier number drawn, and they can win up to 5million.BeginningOctober19,2013,theMegaMillionsgameintroducedanewfeaturecalled"JusttheJackpot."Thisfeatureallowsplayerstopurchaseaticketfor3, which gives them two plays for the jackpot prize only, excluding any lower-tier prizes. This option was introduced to attract more players and increase the size of the jackpot. Overall, state lotteries have proven to be a successful means of generating revenue for public expenses, but it is important to remember that the chances of winning the jackpot are extremely slim. Looks can be deceptive when it comes to lottery winnings.

Populations that can be modeled by the modified logistic equation dP = PbP-a dt can either trend toward extinction or exhibit unbounded growth in finite time, depending on the initial population size. If b = 0.0015 and a = 0.28, use phase portrait analysis to determine which of the two limiting behaviors will be exhibited by populations with the indicated initial sizes. Initial population is 59 individuals. Initial population is 510 individuals. a. Doomsday scenario: Population will exhibit unbounded growth in finite time. b. Population will trend towards extinction. There is also a constant equilibrium solution for the population. Find this solution (note that the solution often is not a whole number, and hence unrealistic for population modeling). P(t) Solve the modified logistic equation using the values of a and b given above, and an initial population of P0 = 510. P(t) Find the time T such that P(t) goes to zero as t approaches T.

Problem #5: Cooperative Games Suppose that there are 100 students individually trying to decide between taking Game Theory or Public Economics. As we all know, it is harder to get personalized help from the instructor in larger classes. Therefore, the more students in a class, the less useful it is to any one of them. Let the payoffs uc and up from taking Game Theory or Public Economics, respectively, be given by: u(n) = 500 - nc u(p) = 556 - 3np A) Find all of the equilibria in this game that involve whole numbers of students. It may help to restate the payoffs so that both are in terms of np or both in terms of nc. B) Of the equilibria you found, which are stable, and which are unstable? For full credit, your answer must be accompanied by a graph. C) What allocation of students would maximize social welfare? Remember that there are only 100 students.
The Stark effect concerns the physics of an atom in an electric field. Here, you will explore the possibility that when placed in an electric field, the electron in an atom can tunnel out, making the atomic bound states unstable. We consider this effect in a simpler one-dimensional analog: Consider an electron trapped in a one-dimensional square well of depth Vo and width d: V(z) ~ Vo; for |x| < d/2, V(z) = 0; for |x| > d/2 Suppose there is a weak constant electric field in the negative z-direction with magnitude E. With this field present, the potential experienced by the electron becomes Ve(z), given by: Ve(z) = V(z) + eEz (e > 0) Assume throughout this problem that the two following inequalities hold: Inequality A: 2md^2 < h^2 Inequality B: ce < d It is worth thinking about what these inequalities mean. a) Set e = 0 in this part of the problem. Estimate the ground state energy E1 by recalling that the well is very deep (Inequality A). Is the true ground state energy (still with e = 0) lower or higher than what you've estimated? Explain clearly. Sketch the potential Ve(z) with e â‰  0. Are there bound states in this potential? Use the semiclassical approximation to calculate the tunneling probability T for the ground state. [Use Inequalities A and B to simplify this part of the problem; and to conclude that the particle energy is approximately -Vo.] As usual, write the answer in the form T exp(...), where the dots indicate an expression that depends on h, m, Vo, e, and d. Use classical arguments to convert the tunneling probability T into an estimate of the lifetime of the bound state. The answer can be written in the form t = h/T. Determine t in terms of m, d, h, and numerical constants. (Ignore the effect of the perturbation for the purpose of this computation.) Now consider numbers that are characteristic of an atomic system. Calculate the lifetime for Vo = 20eV, d = 2 * 10^-10 cm, and electric field e = 10^7 V/cm. Write your answer in the form exp(8) sec. Write the age of the universe Tu in a similar fashion, exp(? SCC). Write exp(0)ru, and determine e. How does the decay rate w = 1/t depend on the perturbation e? How does it and its derivatives with respect to e behave as e approaches 0? Could it be calculated by treating e as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian?

The Student Council organized a potato catapult contest on the school field. Students used catapults to shoot the potatoes into the air and down the field. Some students launched the potatoes while other students were in charge of collecting data using motion detectors and timers. Students analyzed the data to describe the path that each potato followed. Each team launched their potato and the data collected was plotted on the following graph: The distance (in feet) from the goal line is plotted on the x-axis. The y-axis represents the height (in feet). Team A launched their potato. According to the data collected, they determined the function that modeled the potato path by the equation y = âˆš(x - 15)^2 + 81, where x is the distance from the goal line (in feet) and y is the height of the potato (in feet). Team B's potato flew through the air and landed down the field. Using the data they collected, Team B calculated that the equation of the path of the potato through the air was 0.75x^2 + 18x, where x is the distance from the goal line (in feet) and y is the height of the potato (in feet).
